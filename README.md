cldoc is a clang based documentation generator for C/C++

## Runtime dependencies
The only runtime dependency of cldoc is libclang (>= 3.1) and obviously python.

## Build dependencies:
* coffeescript compiler
* sass compiler
* inliner

These build dependencies are used to generate the html webapp which renders
the documentation generated by cldoc. These are only needed once at build time.
The coffeescript compiler and inliner are usually installed easiest
by using `npm install coffee-script inliner`. sass can be installed using
`gem install --user-install sass`. It's also possible that your system provides
packages for these dependencies.

After the requirements are installed, simply run `python setup.py install` to
install cldoc. Note that if you have used npm and gem to install coffeescript,
sass and inliner locally (e.g. in node_modules/ and ~/.gem), use:

    python setup.py install \
    	--coffee=node_modules/.bin/coffee \
    	--sass=~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin/sass \
    	--inliner=node_modules/.bin/inliner

or something similar depending on where they actually got installed. You only
need to do this if the `coffee`, `sass` and `inliner` executables are not in
your `$PATH`.
