{"tagline":"clang based documentation generator for C and C++","name":"cldoc","body":"cldoc is a clang based documentation generator for C/C++\r\n\r\n## Runtime dependencies\r\nThe only runtime dependency of cldoc is libclang (>= 3.1) and obviously python.\r\n\r\n## Build dependencies:\r\n* coffeescript compiler\r\n* sass compiler\r\n* inliner\r\n\r\nThese build dependencies are used to generate the html webapp which renders\r\nthe documentation generated by cldoc. These are only needed once at build time.\r\nThe coffeescript compiler and inliner are usually installed easiest\r\nby using `npm install coffee-script inliner`. sass can be installed using\r\n`gem install --user-install sass`. It's also possible that your system provides\r\npackages for these dependencies.\r\n\r\nAfter the requirements are installed, simply run `python setup.py install` to\r\ninstall cldoc. Note that if you have used npm and gem to install coffeescript,\r\nsass and inliner locally (e.g. in node_modules/ and ~/.gem), use:\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install \\\r\n    \t--coffee=node_modules/.bin/coffee \\\r\n    \t--sass=~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin/sass \\\r\n    \t--inliner=node_modules/.bin/inliner\r\n\r\nor something similar depending on where they actually got installed. You only\r\nneed to do this if the `coffee`, `sass` and `inliner` executables are not in\r\nyour `$PATH`.\r\n\r\n## Directory structure:\r\n\r\n    |--- cldoc/\r\n    |    the cldoc python package\r\n    |\r\n    |--- html/\r\n    |    the html/js application for use with the html output\r\n    |\r\n    |--- scripts/\r\n    |  \\--- cldoc\r\n    |       the cldoc tool main script\r\n    |\r\n    |--- setup.py\r\n         python distutils setup script\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
